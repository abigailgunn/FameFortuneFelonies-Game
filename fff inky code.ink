You’re from a small town in the middle of nowhere in the Midwest. Nothing for miles but corn and wheat fields. For fun, you tip cows and party in a run-down barn. It's nice, humble, but ever since you were a little girl, you dreamed of more.
You were in every local play and talent show, and you starred in your senior year’s high school showcase. You craved the spotlight. You loved it. But now, working at the minimart down the road feels like it's draining your life. It’s exhausting, and it's not enough.
So, you do the one thing you promised yourself to do as a little girl. The one thing you always knew was meant for you, even if you were too scared to admit it until now.
You buy a one-way ticket to L.A., pack your bags with no plans, and hop on the next flight.
Your name is Ayla Bernard, and you will be the next All-American girl, the queen of the red carpet, with a bright shiny star on the Walk of Fame…
Or… will you?
*Yes, I will! ->next 
*I will give it a shot! ->next
==next==
You find yourself a cheap, cramped studio apartment, small, a little bit moldy, and even more rusty. But it’s yours. You’ve got just enough in the bank to cover this month’s rent. Next month? That’s another story.
Wandering the streets, you spot a "Help Wanted" sign taped to the window of a run-down midnight diner. The question of money draws you in.
You push open the door and ask the basics.
“What’s the pay? What are the hours?”
The answers are... underwhelming. Barely minimum wage, long nights and days, unpredictable shifts.
But the owner, a gruff woman with tired eyes, shrugs and says, “You can start tomorrow, if you want the gig.”
So what do you do?
* You decide to take the job, you can’t risk going home because you can’t afford the rent. Stability is worth the sacrifice. ->page4
*You reject the job. You must put 100% effort into acting. Can’t have a single distraction. ->page3 
==page3==
You turn down the diner job. The hours are too long, too unpredictable, and you didn’t come all this way to wait tables. If you’re going to make it, you need to give this dream everything you’ve got. No distractions. You’re confident you'll land a few gigs before rent is due. You have to.
You start scouring casting sites and bulletin boards, and that’s when you see it: Lead role. Young female. New Marvel movie.
It doesn’t say much else, but it doesn’t need to. This could be the break.
The audition is first thing the next morning. You wake up only to realize you have no idea how the bus system works. You’re on the wrong side of the city with no clue which route to take, and you definitely can’t afford a taxi.
Your choices narrow down fast:
Hitchhike to the audition… or miss the opportunity of a lifetime.
What do you do?
*Hitchhike, it’s not the 90's anymore. It is safe. ->hitchhike
*Nothing is worth the risk of putting yourself in a scary situation. Not even a Marvel movie. Move on. ->endend
==page4==

Lead role. Young female. New Marvel movie.
There aren’t many details, but it doesn’t matter. This could be the break. The kind of opportunity you dreamed about back in the Midwest.
But there’s one problem: the audition is scheduled for the same time as your first shift at the diner.
So now you’re faced with a choice:
Do you quit the job and chase the opportunity of a lifetime, or do you show up to work, telling yourself there will always be another audition?
*Quit the job, this could be the big break! ->page6
*A stable income is worth more than a maybe. Keep your job and go to work. ->page5
==page5==
Good news: you went to work. You showed up, kept your head down, and did the job. The casting calls haven’t been great—nothing worth skipping a shift over—but at least now you can afford rent. And for now, that’s what matters.
Besides, you heard on the news that they ended up giving the lead role to Jennifer Aniston. So really, it wouldn’t have worked out for you anyway… right? ->endend
==page6==
You decide to quit the job, ready to make it
to the big Marvel Movie audition the next
morning.
You wake up only to realize you have no idea
how the bus system works. You’re on the
wrong side of the city with no clue which
route to take, and you definitely can’t afford
a taxi.
Your choices narrow down fast:
Hitchhike to the audition… or miss the
opportunity of a lifetime.
What do you do?
*Hitchhike ->hitchhike
*Head Home, this is Not worth the risk. ->endend
==hitchhike==
You stick your thumb out waiting for someone
to pull over. To your luck, two cars pull over.
One is a massive semi-truck. Behind the wheel
sits a giant of a man, deep-set eyes peering out
from beneath a thick, ungroomed beard. The
smell of spoiled milk seeps from the open
window.
The other is a sleek black SUV. The driver is a
young, attractive guy with kind eyes and a
warm smile. He gestures for you to hop in.
Which car do you pick?
*Older Man -> goto
*Younger Man ->end1
==end1==
Unfortunately, looks are
deceiving; Mr. Young and
attractive is the modern-day Ted
Bundy. Uh Oh, let’s just say you
didn’t make it out alive. But on
the bright side, you did become
famous, as you were mentioned
in a future crime documentary
about missing people in LA! So, a
win after all???
*End Game? ->endend
==goto==
Looks can be deceiving. He may have been
an oddball who smelled vaguely of spoiled
milk, but he turned out to be a total
sweetheart. He drove you all the way to the
audition with a grin and one request:
“When
you make it big, save me a ticket to the
Oscars!”
You walk into the building, ready to give it
everything you’ve got.
Just to learn:
The auditions have been canceled.
Jennifer Aniston read for the role earlier
that morning and got it on the spot.
All that chaos, all that hope… for nothing.
*Head Home ->endend
